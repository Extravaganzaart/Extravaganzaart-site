<p>I am an artist creating digital artworks that bring emotion, elegance, and energy into living spaces. My paintings are not just decoration.</p>
<p>I create works that adorn interiors; shop windows, galleries, showrooms, and catwalks; art books, banners, and billboards; become part of the visual design of exhibitions, presentations, fashion and other magazines, music studios, album covers, and stage setups; inspire the fashion industry—from fabric prints to lookbooks and presentations.</p>
<p>They come to life on the screens of phones, tablets, computers, televisions, and advertising panels. They are used in moviemaking as atmospheric elements of virtual interiors, scenes, visual accents, screensavers, posters, and much more. Digital art lives wherever you want to see beauty, emotion, and style.</p>
<p>Digital paintings offer flexibility and freedom. They can be transferred not only onto canvas, but also onto many other surfaces, transforming them into unique art objects. They are printed on glass, textiles, plastic, metal, wood, paper, and even leather.</p>
<p>Each of my works is not just an image, but a unique piece that is available only once or twice at most and is not intended for mass distribution. This makes each purchase truly unique — like a personal touch of art that will never be repeated.</p>
<p>All my paintings are delivered in RGB color profile, in PNG or JPG formats, in 4K resolution and above via a secure cloud link after purchase. Published versions are reduced in size and protected.</p>
